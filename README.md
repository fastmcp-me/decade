## Overview

**refund.decide.fyi** is a stateless, deterministic API that provides authoritative refund eligibility signals for US consumer subscriptions. It returns one of three verdicts:

- **ALLOWED** - Refund is within the vendor's refund window
- **DENIED** - Refund window has expired or vendor doesn't offer refunds
- **UNKNOWN** - Unable to determine eligibility (unsupported vendor, region, or plan)

Perfect for:
- AI agents that need reliable refund policy data
- Customer support tools
- Financial applications
- Subscription management platforms

## Architecture

- **Stateless** - No database, no sessions, no side effects
- **Deterministic** - Same input always produces same output
- **Versioned Rules** - Rules file includes version for tracking changes
- **Serverless** - Runs on Vercel Edge Functions for global low latency
- **Zero Dependencies** - Core compute logic has no external dependencies

## Data Sources

Refund policy data is compiled from official vendor documentation and terms of service. Data is manually curated and verified. Rules version is updated whenever policy changes are detected.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-15

## Limitations

- **US Only** - Currently only supports US region
- **Individual Plans Only** - Business/enterprise plans not yet supported
- **Calendar Days** - Refund windows are based on calendar days, not business days
- **No Pro-rating** - Does not calculate partial refunds or pro-rated amounts
- **Static Rules** - Does not account for promotional offers or special circumstances

## Changelog

**Added:**
- Initial release
- REST API endpoint
- MCP server implementation
- Support for 9 major vendors (Adobe, Spotify, Netflix, Microsoft 365, Apple App Store, Google Play, Notion, Canva, Dropbox)
